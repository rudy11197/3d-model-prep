This is a model viewer with added features that I use to prepare models for use in my Game, **Diabolical: The Shooter**  http://blog.diabolicalgame.co.uk/

Features:
  * Keyboard and mouse movement.
  * Orbit round the model.
  * Load animations and select which ones to play.
  * Show or hide the floor.
  * Rotate models and animations while loading.
  * Split FBX files in to separate FBX files with only one animation in each.

Some of the output formats are proprietory and only suitable for my own games but as it is only distributed in source code format that could easily be changed.

Proprietory Features:
  * Add bounding shapes to models.
  * Save model properties files.
  * Batch process animations, name them and output in keyframe format.

This project uses components from the XNA pipeline that cannot be redistributed so it will only work on a development machine and is therefore only available as source code.<br>
<br>
It includes all the code from my earlier TakeExtractor project with added 3D camera movement using the keyboard and mouse plus lots more.<br>
